# Plan of attack


## TODO:
1. Forward pass with uniform probabilities
2. Backward pass adding multi-cuts
3. First markov states
4. Price transition
5. Solve upper and lower price rib
6. Cut rebuilding
7. Async

- scenario incrementation
- max iterations
- bound stalling
- confidence interval
- uniform sampling
- expected value iterations
- non-convexity
- add cuts to all markov states backward pass
- parallelism
    - asyncronous cutting passes
    - simulation
- automatic rescaling of the problem

## what not to include
- regularisation
